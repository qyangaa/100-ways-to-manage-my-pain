## My Journey

My chronic neck pain started when I was 12. Since then, it has always been the background motif of my life. My pain limited the time I can spend sitting, reading, and working with the computer, so I treasure every minute doing those activities so much that my performance improved. I pushed hard through my schools in China, obtained good grades, and got admitted to nice colleges. However, during the last semester at UC Berkeley, I developed lower back pain which was so bad that I spent the whole semester lying in bed. Luckily that was the last semester so I might as well relax. 

The situation got worse during my Ph.D. study at Caltech. I experienced an unbearable level of pain every time sitting in meetings, developed depression, and the 7-minutes drive to campus became challenging to me because my tears constantly blocked my vision. However, I did maintain a good amount of physical activities every day and kept looking for solutions. I went to the pain center of USC hospital, got SNRI (antidepressant) prescription, and started to see a therapist. The antidepressant pulled me out of the uncontrollable emotions, but my pain was still unbearable. Ramping up the dosage gave me an insomnia of three weeks straight. I was exhausted in the end and decided to give up on the medication. However my therapist was extremely skillful and empathetic, she helped me sort out many of the problems I had, with or without solutions. I decided to quit my Ph.D. (which I couldn’t even imagine before the therapy sessions) and apply to an online master’s program in computer science.

Studying math and coding feels like meditation for me, and I simply enjoy it more than the turmoil of broken instruments and (subjectively) never-working experiments during my Ph.D. I spend a lot of time with my family and myself during the pandemic studying online, exploring a variety of hobbies and fields. My depression gradually dissolved, although pain management is still an ongoing task. 

Now I am one semester away from finishing my Masters’ program, did intern with a company that cares so much about employee wellness, and signed a full-time offer that allows me to work from home permanently and manage my pain comfortably. This is the defining moment to me that I can say I’m not worried about my future and my life anymore. 



## So, why did I start this blog?

As a former researcher and current engineer, curiosity and willingness to explore accompanied me throughout all these years of chronic pain management. I finished 200hr RYT yoga teacher training, got NASM personal trainer certification, read many books on pain psychology, cognitive therapy, and nutrition science, read papers from fields like neuroscience, psychology, nutrition science, kinesiology, etc., experimented with different diets, foods, exercise modalities, ergonomic setups and more. Seeing doctors and therapists from different fields was also part of the journey. I have collected so many scientific and lifestyle resources that helped me tremendously during the journey. I have found over 100 ways to manage my pain.

Pain management is a highly personal journey, approaches that work for one person might not work for another. But I hope an organized and summarized repository of information could be helpful for those like me, as inspirations to try new modalities, or simply as a seed of hope so as we know there are many more that we can do.
